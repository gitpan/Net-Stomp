Revision history for Perl module Net::Stomp:

0.36 Fri May 28 16:20::15 BST 2010
  - Fix behaviour regression on constructor - 0.35 would look at ->new time if
    no server could be reached. We now die after trying each server once.

0.35 Tue May 25 15:55:36 BST 2010
  - add some examples
  - add support for SSL (thanks to Aleksandar Ivanisevic)
  - add send_transactional (based on Net::Stomp::Receipt, thanks
    to Hugo Salgado)
  - add some convenience methods for accessing headers in a frame
    (thanks to Claes Jakobsson)
  - receive_frame now accepts a {timeout=>1} option
  - failover support (thanks to Thom May and Ash Berlin)
  - reconnect and resubscribe when connection failes (Thom May)

0.34 Fri Jun 27 09:29:13 BST 2008
  - revert to 0.32's code, as the last release broke things that
    I don't have time to fix right now 

0.33 Wed Jun 25 08:45:59 BST 2008
  - fixes from Paul Driver: can_read doesn't behave correctly. The 
    docs say it returns true iff there's a frame waiting to be 
    read, but it's just a select() call to see if there's data 
    on the socket, which can return both false positives and
    false negatives. While investigating this, I noticed that 
    Net::Stomp::Frame->parse was modified at some point to take
    a socket as its argument. This is inconsistent with docs and
    probably not what was wanted anyway. parse and as_string 
    should be symmetrical. Attached is a patch that fixes both 
    issues and adds tests for them.

0.32 Sun Oct 29 09:06:31 GMT 2006
  - rewrote the parser to add support for BytesMessage, which should
    allow Java<->Perl messages (thanks to Hiram Chirino and Sileshi
    Kassa)
  - set binmode() on the socket so Windows should now work (thanks
    to Sileshi Kassa)

0.31 Wed Oct 11 17:28:31 BST 2006
  - minor docpatch noticed by Leo Lapworth
  - tweak frame parser
  - add unsubscribe() method
  - add can_read() method

0.30 Sat Oct  7 09:47:57 BST 2006
  - initial release
