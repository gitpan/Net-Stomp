Revision history for Perl module Net::Stomp:

0.34 Fri Jun 27 09:29:13 BST 2008
  - revert to 0.32's code, as the last release broke things that
    I don't have time to fix right now 

0.33 Wed Jun 25 08:45:59 BST 2008
  - fixes from Paul Driver: can_read doesn't behave correctly. The 
    docs say it returns true iff there's a frame waiting to be 
    read, but it's just a select() call to see if there's data 
    on the socket, which can return both false positives and
    false negatives. While investigating this, I noticed that 
    Net::Stomp::Frame->parse was modified at some point to take
    a socket as its argument. This is inconsistent with docs and
    probably not what was wanted anyway. parse and as_string 
    should be symmetrical. Attached is a patch that fixes both 
    issues and adds tests for them.

0.32 Sun Oct 29 09:06:31 GMT 2006
  - rewrote the parser to add support for BytesMessage, which should
    allow Java<->Perl messages (thanks to Hiram Chirino and Sileshi
    Kassa)
  - set binmode() on the socket so Windows should now work (thanks
    to Sileshi Kassa)

0.31 Wed Oct 11 17:28:31 BST 2006
  - minor docpatch noticed by Leo Lapworth
  - tweak frame parser
  - add unsubscribe() method
  - add can_read() method

0.30 Sat Oct  7 09:47:57 BST 2006
